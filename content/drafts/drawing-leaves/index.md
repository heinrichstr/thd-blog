## How do I draw tree leaves?

Why is it that every tree tutorial starts simple--draw the shape of the tree, draw the shape that the leaf clumps make-- but then immediately goes from a basic construction to a finished detailed drawing? Some tutorials I've found out there don't even look like their tree's have leaves! Drawing leaves on a tree is difficult. A large reason is because the approach you need to take to draw leaves changes drastically from a close-up view to a far away view. Also, leaves are extremely repetitive and there are *a lot* of leaves on trees. To draw every leaf would be maddening, yet to not can often leave a drawing feeling like there was a very big detail missing.

So how do I draw leaves? I've worked quite a while at this subject and I've come to a conclusion: You should paint them! It's way easier as you can do large areas at a time and the texture of a paintbrush lets you make a lot of leaf-looking shapes very easily. Unfortunately, we don't always have paint lying around. Because of this I continued to search for a way to draw somewhat realistic tree leaves without losing my mind. Above is the sketch I'll be walking you through so you will have an understanding of how to draw clumps of leaves at a mid-distance. I will try to illustrate the change between the **construction of the drawing** and the **detailing of the drawing** so you are able to make that change as well.

## Draw the shape of a tree&mdash;construction of the drawing

To start, I have a simple tree branch from the side. Note how the branches diverge, they split in twos but not all at once. The branches get slightly thicker where they split and they overlap slightly because they are 3D shapes on a 2D canvas. Feel free to use a reference of a tree branch if you are new. Here is a good example of a solid reference for just the branch: [tree branch reference example](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS2VI6o85F_fKla30jO-DTZq5Zk7Z1_OwWwmB1CdJ23CTrPC3SM)

Moving forward, I usually block in the shape that the leaves will be making. I keep this loose and light as it is just a reference for where my clumps of leaves will be. It also serves as a reference to the *other* side of the leaves on the tree, hence the branches laying on top of this. So far, we haven't done much any other tree leaf drawing tutorial has done. We are still in the *construction phase* of the drawing, where we set up the 3D shapes we are going to detail as we go through the drawing.

## Brief tips on detailing tree leaves

Tree leaf clumps are really just lump spheres. To illustrate this, I drew up a typical sphere. It has a highlight from a lightsource, a shadowed area with a core shadow, an area of reflected light, and an area of occlusion where very little light reaches. The start of a construction-phase sketch does not have to be pretty, as long as you are able to mark the areas you will be drawing in the **detailing of the drawing**.

To detail this 3D object, I drew leaf-shaped outlines and spaced them along where the sphere's surface changes angles. These let you shade the clump predominately in a step-by-step fashion. Note how there are more detailed leaf shapes in the mid-liht areas of the sphere. ***The highlights and core shadows are harder to see leaf shapes in***. This applies to any texture a surface has. It is easiest to see the texture of a surface where the angle of the surface turns from light to shadow.

## Finishing construction of tree leaf clumps

With the above tips in mind, we will start to construct the leaf clumps as a 3D shape, keeping in mind they tend to lay in a spherical shape. I put in a shadow and a highlight. I also make sure to put where the leaves will block the view of the tree branches. We can see the tree branches in the shadow area (as that is usually the shadow side of the leaves on the opposite side of the tree). The sphere shapes are shown on the side. We have finished the basic construction of these tree leaf clumps!
