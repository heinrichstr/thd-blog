## Trees are hard
I’ve worked off and on for the last few years on learning how to draw and paint many different types of natural objects, from birds to grass (and all sorts of things in between). The object with one of the most reoccurring issues for me was _trees_. It felt like every time I went back to draw another tree I had to relearn it from the beginning. It took quite an effort to truly learn how to draw trees and in this article I will share why I believe trees are such a difficult subject matter to draw and paint. 

I will be explaining the fundamentals of drawing trees and also will discuss how these fundamentals change when you are drawing trees vs painting them. _Please note, this article is specifically from my own point of view from research I have done myself and from experiences I have with attempting to capture the subject matter on my own._ 

The goal of this article is to give the reader the ability to research and understand any type of tree they wish to draw and know the steps to take to go from unfamiliarity with a tree to having an accurate understanding of how to draw or paint the subject matter. We will go over the following steps together:

1. Identify what makes that species of tree look the way it does and how it is constructed and understand what makes it look different than other tree species
2. Construct the tree with correct anatomy on the page/canvas
3. Apply the details correctly and accurately so the tree looks like our mind subconsciously already knows how it looks

Trees are hard because, while all trees share similarities between each other, different tree species require an artist to approach them differently. The details and the construction of trees are something we rarely pay attention to, yet if they are off we immediately know that something is wrong. Subconsciously we clock these details from trees we see in the real world and drawing convincing trees requires us to learning these details actively.

For example, lets look at the differences between two types of trees. We will look at the details and construction of pine trees and beech trees. These two trees are often found in close quarters up in the northeastern United States (one of my favorite landscapes to draw and paint from). They are both trees but they have varying differences in their bark type, their limb anatomy, their leaf structure, and the structure of their roots anchoring the tree to the ground.

Those are definitely both trees, yet they look totally different! The basic structure is similar for sure, but look how dissimilar the construction and all the details are for them. To draw these, I had to approach the structure in different ways. Let’s go through how I learned how to draw these trees.

## Draw what you see, not what you “know”
That’s right, you need to look at them. It does no good to draw what you think you see. if you want to draw any trees, you have to get used to drawing what you see. In my opinion, this is why trees are so difficult for people to draw. We all think we know what a tree looks like, we’ve seen so many through our lives, but when we go to actually draw them we learn we only really know what a “basic tree” kind of looks like. In reality their details are often quite different! If you manage to guess the anatomy of a tree’s limbs but draw the wrong kind of bark and leaves, you will find the tree won’t look correct. Getting these anatomical details is important. It’s the same concept for many objects we see a lot. For instance, if you drew a hand with five fingers but no thumb you would notice immediately that something was off.

Let’s walk through the steps for how I ended up figuring out how to draw and paint convincing trees. I went ahead and drew directly from reference and also went out and drew from life. Essentially it went like this. I first found a reference like we will walk through below and tried to understand the details and anatomy of the tree. Once I did this a number of times for different references of the same species of tree I was able to figure out the basics of how to construct a tree of that species. Going forward, I was able to plug those details into any sketch or scene that species of tree fit into well.

I would recommend either having a few tree species of different places under your belt to pull from or make sure to reference trees of the environments you are trying to draw. You likely would not find many pine trees in a hot humid area for example. Drawing convincing trees is one part of the puzzle, but also choosing tree species that make sense for the area is another. Treating the details of the environment like you would the details of the trees you draw will help you keep everything convincing and believable, even if you landscapes are based in a fantasy or sci-fi setting.

## How to learn how to draw trees correctly

I went ahead and labeled some important details that I find change between different tree species. We will go through two sets of trees from the same species (American Beech and Eastern White Pine). 

As we can see from the beech trees above, even in the same species differences like the age of the tree change some of the tree’s details significantly. Seeing these details can help us figure out what to look for when drawing our own. We will be able to make the trees  we draw old or young or if the tree is on the windswept side of the mountain or part of the valley by inserting or removing certain details.

###American Beech trees:
---
* Smooth bark
	* Horizontal bark imperfections
* Vertical trunk
* Limbs start developing medium height off of the ground
* Limbs grow outwards and upwards
	* Older trees have limbs that grow more outwards on the bottom
* Young trunks are cylindrical, old trunks become more “veiny”
* Medium sized leaves, simple teardrop shape
* Somewhat dense foliage from distance, room for light to filter through up close
	* Shape of tree from afar resembles slumped half circle
* Older trees have visible root system
* Older trees often have moss at the base

This gives us a good idea of what Beech trees are like. Let’s walk through Pine trees together as well.

Pine trees are very different from the beech trees above, yet they still look like trees to us. Let’s look at the list of details for pine trees:

###Eastern White Pine
---
* Vertical trunk
* Bark fairly smooth with shallow, vertical cuts
	* Older trees have deeper cuts, younger trees and limbs fairly smooth
* Limbs protrude straight out
	* Limbs orient upwards towards the top
	* Limbs become less straight the higher they originate from
	* Straight limbs cause “rows” of foliage on tree
* Sparse limbs with needle leaves create gaps in foliage where trunk is visible
* Leaves point upwards, limbs show fully when viewed from below
* Very young pines have limbs to the ground, older pines have limbs develop fairly high off the ground

Pine trees are fairly different from the beech trees above. Were these differences surprising to you to see? When I first mapped out the details of different tree species I started to understand why my drawn trees didn’t look right. It’s because they weren’t right. I didn’t know how these trees were constructed because I didn’t figure out how they were constructed first. Once I started correctly constructing trees and drawing their details accurately, I realized I could finally draw convincing trees!

## Let’s draw a tree together
In part two of this series, we will draw the American Beech Tree together. I will go over what to look for and how to detail out the tree itself. I will go over some common pitfalls and some differences to the approach when drawing vs painting trees.

Before we go into the next post of the series, let us look at some quick homework that will help you understand the process yourself.

### Homework:
Find a tree species and list out the details that make this tree special. Below is a list of details to look for:
* Bark type—Is it smooth or textured?
* Trunk—Is it straight? Thin or thick? Does it stay cylindrical or can it be a different shape?
* Foliage—Is it sparse or dense
* Leaf size—Is it large or small
* Limbs—Do they jut out straight or do they wind around? Do they point upwards or outwards?
* Roots—Are they visible or do they stay under the surface
* Age—Do any of the above details change between young and older trees in this species?
